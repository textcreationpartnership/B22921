            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Somethings propoſed in general, towards the better clearing the common notion of juſtification. Juſtication is an act of juſtice. Onely juſt men can be juſtly juſtified. Thoſe who are once unjuſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acquitted as juſt without a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.

God neither did nor could pronounce him guiltleſs of the murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he could and did remit the ſentence of death. That none but thoſe who are juſt or made juſt, can be juſtly juſtified, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further here. (1.)

               <p>Poſſibly it may be objected that God is ſaid to <hi>justifie</hi> the <hi>un godly,</hi> Rom. 4. 5. and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are unjuſt, may be juſtly juſtified. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, God juſtifies thoſe who are guilty of ſin, and doth juſtly in ſo doing, in that Chriſt hath made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for their ſin, and through ſaith they can plead an intereſt in it, ſo that it becomes theirs, and is accounted to them for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

But if the Author of that diſcourſe be as teachable as he is ignorant, he may once for all take notice, that the freeneſs of remiſſion doth not conſiſt in the want of a ſatisfaction, or in any defect in the ſatisfaction that is made; but in theſe four other things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that though he exact a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he doth not exact it, at the hand of the <hi>delinquent.</hi> In the rigour of the Law, the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal himſelf ſhould bear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment! and here <hi>ſi alius ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, aliud ſolvitur.</hi> Now is not this grace? that though he will have his juſtice ſatisfied, yet he will diſpenſe ſo far with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor,<note place="margin">Solvere dicitur qui per ſe pretium numerat, ſatisfacere qui quod alius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet ſelvit.</note> as not to demand <hi>ſolution</hi> from himſelf, but he will allow the <hi>ſubſtitution</hi> of a Surety to make the <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and take <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for <hi>ſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he both contrived the ſatisfaction, and gave his own Son
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180409:22"/> to make it. Suppoſing that he would have accepted a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he might haue left it to the offendor, to have found out the way and the means to have made it: whatever diminitive thoughts the Sociniaus may have of this, I am ſure the Scripture every where delivers it as a fruit and reſult of inexpreſſible love; <hi>Joh. 2. 16: Rom. 5. 8. 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10. In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins.</hi> Was there no grace in Chriſt <hi>his</hi> Interpoſing for us, and not for Angels? was God under any obligation to fallen man, that he behoved to recover him more than fallen Angels? Might not God have honoured his juſtice in the damnation of both alike, and that without the leaſt

               <p n="3">3.

Now that grace and life ſhould be bought by it to ſome, and not others, as it is ſolely to be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the pleaſure of the Father and Son, deſigning and uſing it to that purpoſe; ſo it is the effect and iſſue of high mercy and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing love at leaſure, ſee <hi>Joh. 17. 19. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180409:24"/> and accepted as a ſatisfaction in behalf of ſome, ſo that in due time the Father, becauſe of that, ſhould beſtow grace upon, and be reconciled to ſuch; others, in the meane time, being left under the power of their luſts and ſins, and obnoxious to God's wrath and enmity? Whatever apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſort of men have of it, there are others who deſire to take notice of, and admire it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The freeneſs of God's grace towards ſinners, ſtands in the free and effectual application of the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt to them; his free donation of the ſpirit to ſome, to work faith in them, and to bring them up to the conditions, upon which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt and pardon through it is only pleadable. The Father and Son having contrived and brought about this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any help or riſe from us, <hi>We could have no actual intereſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180409:24"/> in the benefits of it, but upon ſuch tearms as the Father and Son ſhould agree to.</hi> It is true, if we our ſelves had made the ſatisfaction, that then without the intervention of any new condition, both Law and Juſtice would have diſcharged us. But that being done by others, without any contrivance or influence of ours, the benefit of it is not to be expected by us, but upon ſuch conditions as thoſe who brought about and accompliſhed that work think fit to appoint. Now it having pleaſed the Father and the Son to conſtitute and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, believing as the condition upon which the ſatisfaction of Chriſt ſhould be accounted ours, and without which we ſhould have no intereſt in the benefit of it; and we being both unable and unwilling to believe, our <hi>moral</hi> impotency and inſufficiency to this, being no leſs than our <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> inability and incapacity was to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180409:25"/> the former, <hi>Joh. 16. 44. 1 Cor. 2. 14. Joh.</hi> 6. 29. Is it not then emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent mercy and grace? that while the generality are left under their unwillingneſs, enmity, and inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <hi>God ſhould in ſome work both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>Give them to believe,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whatever low imaginations ſome have of this, there are others will not ceaſe to adore that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and eminent love and mercy which unfolds it ſelf in it.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly ſhown wherein the Grace of God in the pardoning of ſin conſiſts; though he pardon none but with reſpect to, and upon the account of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I return to that which I was upon, namely, that to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified upon the Plea of meer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is both <hi>perfect nonſenſe,</hi> and <hi>a formal contradiction.</hi> Whatever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180409:25"/> theſe high maſters of reaſon think of it, we poorer mortals uſe to account it nonſenſe, to ſay a man is juſtified, when he is meerly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and according to our little Philoſophy we eſteem it a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to make that the <hi>alone ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of mercy,</hi> wherein <hi>juſtice hath</hi> only to do. And our adverſary muſt give us leave to retort his own Phraſe, with this little alteration upon himſelf, that he and his friends are abſurd not only in their Faith, but in their Reaſon: As we are juſtified, God acts only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in way of righteouſneſs; as we are pardoned, he acts only towards us in way of mercy. But as in <hi>being ſaved,</hi> we are both <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> ſo in the <hi>whole</hi> of our <hi>recovery,</hi> there is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful combination and union of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and juſtice.</p>
               <p>Now though this were enough to overthrow our being juſtified upon the Plea of mercy, for the

So to deny or hate God are eſſentially evil, previouſly to any prohibition of God about them; otherwiſe they might have been duties ſuppoſing God had commanded them, which he might have done, if they were in themſelves things indifferent, and became evil only from his free prohibition; but that theſe could have heen duties, I think no man dare ſay, that knows whereof he affirms.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180409:63"/> The damned are alwiſe paying their debt, but yet never pay it. Now Chriſt hath ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the full. (3.) In that juſtice hath not only all its demands, but is obliged with a ſurpluſage; he that was our creditor, is become our debtor; there is more honor ariſeth to God from Chriſt's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, than he ſuffered diſhonor by our ſins. <hi>3ly.</hi> For his wiſdom, how wonderfully is that diſplay'd in the whole tranſaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the debt pay'd, and yet the debtor forgiven; ſin puniſhed, and yet the ſinner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted: God at once infinitely righteous, and withal gracious.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:180409:64"/> only what is abſolutely included in the threatning, we ſhall find no more but this, namely, that the ſinner ought to undergo, both as to ſenſe and loſs as much as it is poſſible for a creature to bear. The law principally eyes the quality and the weight of the puniſhment, not ſo much the duration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. The living and dying in Priſon is no part of a man's debt, neither is that the primary intention of the law towards any, yet this comes juſtly to be his lot, that will not, or cannot pay his debt. That which lyes then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally in the threatning <hi>is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. <hi>wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. <hi>and the curſe</hi> Gal. 3. 10. but that this is eternal, ariſeth meerly from the finiteneſs and weakneſs of the creature: If a ſinner could at once bear that which is proportionable and equal in juſtice to his crime, and by ſo doing make ſatisfaction, there might in time be an end of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180409:64"/> puniſhment, but this he cannot do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd therefore muſt ſuffer forever according to what he is capable of bearing. Now Chriſt was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo only what was formally in the threatning, to bear the weight of it, and having by bearing of it made ſatlsfaction, he was no ways concerned in the eternity and duration of the puniſhment, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſelf diſcharging him, the debt being pay'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe effects which flow naturally from ſuffering, and thoſe which through the corruption of the party puniſhed, flow only accidentally from it.</hi> If the Socinians would be pleaſed to take notice of this, they would eaſe us the trouble of that thread-bare objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe Chriſt underwent the puniſhment of the law, he beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to diſpair and blaſpheme, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as theſe do not flow natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from ſuffering, but proceed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180409:65"/> meerly from the corruption and imbecillity of thoſe that ſuffer. A perſon may undergo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without either murmuring at the Judge who ſentenceth him, or reproaching the law by which he is condemned. The blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a damned ſinner ariſeth in way of cauſation meerly from his own corruption, his pains are at moſt but occaſional of it; and while he had mercies they iſſued in the like effects. For the diſpair of a damned perſon, it proceeds hence, that he knows he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make ſatisfaction, nor extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf from under what he feels. Now it was not poſſible, that either of theſe ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt; not the firſt, ſeeing he was perfectly holy in his nature, without any principle of or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſin: Not the ſecond, in that he knew himſelf able to make God a ſatisfaction, and foreſaw, and believed a glorious iſſue from all his pains.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:180409:65"/>3. <hi>We muſt make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe ſufferings which were directly in the threatning, and thoſe that were only conſequentially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in it.</hi> Thoſe, that the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be made obnoxious to, though it be holy and innocent; and thoſe that follow the humane nature, as exiſting only in our ſinful perſons. Chriſt aſſumed only the common nature of man, and not the perſon of any man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was neither ſubject to paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſorders of mind, nor pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſickneſſes of body; ſeeing theſe do not appertain to the eſſence of the humane nature, but only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it as it exiſts in our ſinful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I come now to prove that Chriſt hath ſuffered what we ſhould have ſuffered; and that the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty which was due to us was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him: the death and curſe which the law denounced
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180409:66"/> againſt the ſinner, Chriſt as the Surety bore.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment which was due to us conſiſted of two parts, death and the curſe to be inflicted upon us; and the favour of God to be ſuſpended and withdrawn from us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which was expreſly denounced, as the penalty of ſin was death and the curſe, <hi>Gen. 2. 17. Deut. 27. 26. Rom 6. 23. Rom. 5. 12. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. And this, and no leſs; this very puniſhment, and not an other did Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: the ſame ſentente of the law, which ſhould have been executed upon us, was executed upon him. There was a change of perſons, the Surety ſuffering for the Debtor, the juſt for, the unjuſt; but no change of puniſhment at all. <hi>Chriſt taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death,</hi> Heb. 2 9. <hi>was put to death,</hi> Joh. 18. 31, 32. <hi>became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. <hi>bore the curſe,</hi>

This we confirm from the enſuing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Where by being reconciled is principally meant, God's being reconciled to us, as appears,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe the reconciliation ſpoken of here, is that to which juſtification is equivalent, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. but juſtification is God's reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to us, not our converſion to him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In that the reconciliation here intended, is that which is the immediate effect of the death of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180409:94"/> Chriſt; and conſequently we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand by it the reconciling of our natures to God, this being immediat fruit of the ſpirit of Chriſt, (for though remotely it be founded on the death of Chriſt, yet in Scripture it is made the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of the reſurrection, life, and power of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. and latter part of this ſame <hi>verſe 10. Much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by the death of his Son, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi>) But we muſt neceſſarily underſtand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of God to us.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Becauſe the reconciliation here ſpoken of is that which is tendred to us, and which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>ver. 11.—have received the atonement,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or converſion to God, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are not ſaid to receive our converſion, or to have our converſion tendred to us, but muſt needs be ſpoken in reference to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:180409:95"/> the appeaſing of God's anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and our acceptation with him; and accordingly the Syriack renders it, <hi>Reconciliatus eſt nobiſcum Deus,</hi> God was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us. Another Scripture which offers for the further eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of this is, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and hath given us the miniſtry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, now then we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> Beſides the reconciliation of man to God by converſion, mentioned in the latter end of the 20 <hi>verſ.</hi> and to which we are there exhorted: There is alſo mention of God's reconciliation to us, and

Now that Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a Prieſt as is here deſcribed, is manifeſt in that all the parts of this deſcription do admirably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to him; he was taken from among men. To this very end principally, and none other, did he partake of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. He was alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for men, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. and herein he excelled all other Prieſts that he was conſtituted only for others, and not for himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. Laſtly, he was ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices, yea here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he tranſcended all other Prieſts, that he had ſomething of his own to offer; other Prieſts had indeed ſomething to offer, but nothing of their own; they only offered the bodies of beaſts, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple brought them, but Chriſt had a body given him to be at this own diſpoſal to this purpoſe. That
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:180409:101"/> this deſcription of a Prieſt belongs properly to Chriſt, yea, that it is he whom the Holy Ghoſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſcribes, may be put out of queſtion, by obſerving that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle applies it <hi>ver.</hi> 5. particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That Chriſt was properly a Prieſt, may be further eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Heb. 8. 3. Every high Priest is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices: wherefore it is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that this man have ſomewhat alſo to offer.</hi> Now if Chriſt be not truly a Prieſt, this way of arguing is altogether impertinent; for it might be eaſily replyed, that though it be needful that a Prieſt properly ſo called, ſhould have ſomewhat to offer, yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he who is only meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically a Prieſt, ſhould have any thing to to offer; for it is no ways needful, that whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to that which is true and real, ſhould alſo appertain to that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180409:101"/> which is figurative and improper. Though a man be a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it doth not follow that the picture of a man ſhould be ſo. And therefore the Apoſtle by concluding that Chriſt behoved to have ſomewhat to offer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Prieſt, mvſt needs intend that he was a Prieſt in a proper, and not in a metaphorical ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It appears further, that Chriſt was truly and properly a Prieſt, in that he was a Prieſt of a true and proper order, namely, of the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Pſal. 110. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 10. and 7. 17. 21. I do not now diſpute who <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch ſedeck</hi> was, all that I affirm is, that according to the Holy Ghoſt he was a real Prieſt, and that his order was a real order, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt being of a true order, behoved alſo to be a true Prieſt. As the Levitical Prieſts were truely and properly Prieſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  </gap>ion in the offenders behalf to the Court; and ſo by making ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:180409:109"/> to the Bench, he makes alſo ſatisfaction to himſelf, foraſmuch as he is a member of it. So God being in this whole affair conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Governour, and not as a meer Creditor, it is no pageantry to affirm that he might ſatisfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. Upon ſuppoſition that Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction, yet it doth not follow that <hi>adequatè</hi> he hath made it to himſelf, ſeeing he made it as God man, and it was made to him only as God. Now as there is nothing more uſual in Scripture than to affirm contrary things of Chriſt under different reſpects; for example, <hi>that the Father is greater than he,</hi> Joh. 14. 28. <hi>and yet that the Father and he are one,</hi> Joh. 10. 30. <hi>that he is Gods equal,</hi> Phil. 2 6. <hi>and yet Gods ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:180409:109"/> the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, which is the alone plea upon which we can be juſtified, the next enquiry is how upon this plea, we come to be juſtified.</p>

            <div n="9" type="chapter">

               <argument>
                  <p>How upon the Plea of a ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, we are juſtified. The ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt effectual before made, as well as after. None actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till they believe what juſtification is.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving fully eſtabliſhed the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, which is the only plea a guilty ſinner hath why he ſhould be juſtified, that which falls next under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is how upon this Plea we come to be juſtified, or how we come to have an intereſt in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made by Chriſt, ſo as by vertue of that <hi>Plea</hi> to be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:180409:110"/> I had intended and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſted my thoughts to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length on this ſubject, and treated the whole intereſt both of faith and works in this affair; but finding this treatiſe already lengthened beyond what the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may deſire, though much ſhort of what the ſubject requires; and not knowing to what bigneſs the <hi>Appendix</hi> may grow, I ſhall not proceed as I had deſigned, but refer it to another ſeaſon, if not wave it forever. Only that the preſent tract may not be wholly imperfect, it will be neceſſary to ſuggeſt a few things.</p>
               <p>This then I would firſt premiſe, that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt was as effectual to juſtification and life to thoſe who could plead it, before it was actually made (he having undertaken it) as it is to thoſe who can now plead it, it is made: the Father acted in the ſame way of juſtifying believers then that he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:180409:110"/> doth now. The blood of Chriſt had the ſame efficacy then which it hath now, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſsion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> The Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Saints were ſaved upon terms of juſtice, as well as the New. God by exacting afterwards full ſatisfaction from Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to have acted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them as a righteous Judge, as well as a gracious Father. This I take to be the intendment of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col. 1. 2. And having made peace through the blood of his Croſs, by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf, by him I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</hi> Whereby things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is meant the Saints already in heaven, who are ſaid now to be reconciled, becauſe the price of their reconciliation was now paid.<note place="margin">See Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. on the place.</note> All that were ſaved then, were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180409:111"/> ſaved alone through <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. In this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral tranſaction betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rher and Son, about the recovery and pardon of ſinners, Divines take notice that there is a mutual truſting of each other; as Chriſt having paid the price and ranſome, takes the Fathers word now, for the bringing in and juſtifying of all thoſe in due time, in whoſe room and ſtead it was paid; ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before received many into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and to glory, upon the Sons promiſe, that in the appointed time he would make <hi>him</hi> a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Having pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>miſed this, there is a twofold juſtification, one funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in Chriſt of all the elect before faith, yet ſo as they abode under wrath till they came actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe; wherein that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts I had at length drawn out, but muſt now forbear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> There is an actual juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180409:111"/> of all the elect in Chriſt upon their believing. The Father and Son having contrived and brought about this great affair of our recovery without any riſe or help from us, we can have no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intereſt in the benefits of it, but upon ſuch termes as the Father and Son have agreed unto. And here I would obſerve theſe two things. 1. The neceſſity that we ſhould not be juſtified, but upon ſome condition. 2. That it was moſt agreeable to the Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that faith ſhould be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was not fit that we ſhould be actually juſtified, but upon ſome condition; and this is the main hinge upon which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact betwixt the Father and Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his undertaking the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, turns, <hi>Iſa. 53. 11. By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> i. e. by the knowledge of him, where know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180409:112"/> (as often elſewhere in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) ſignifies faith. It was not fit that the juſtice of God ſhould acquit us to the impeachment of the Divine purity. The holineſs of God was a bar to our being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into favour, as well as his righteouſneſs; it was needful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a reſpect ſhould be born to that as well as this; and that though juſtice had received a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, yet that the benefits of it ſhould not redound to us, but upon terms of conformity to the purity and holineſs of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So far as can be imagined by us, it was moſt convenient that faith ſhould be the condition. (1.) Becauſe that alone quites all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of being juſtified any other way, and truſts ſolely to be juſtified this way. It is the nature of faith to take us of from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe we are apt to confide in, and to engage us only to depend upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180409:112"/> It is the conſtitution of faith, and no other grace to truſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and to receive and embrace what is there tendred. Hence faith is ſet in oppoſition to ſelf, truſt, and confidence, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. Rom. 9. 31, 32. Rom. 4. 15. Gal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. It is faith alone by which the ſoul owns Chriſt for its ſurety, rolls over it ſelf upon him, ſo that in <hi>conſpectu fore</hi> in the account of the law, Chriſt and the pleader are but one. (2.) Becauſe it is by faith that Chriſt and we come to be ſpiritually united, and as it were concorporated together. Chriſt is brought to dwell in us by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and rooted in him by the ſame, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 7. by faith Chriſt and we become one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. This being then the bond of union betwixt him and us, it was moſt convenient that it ſhould be the condition of our intereſt in him, and of our right to all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:180409:113"/> of his ſatisfaction and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. What this faith is, how it is called our righteouſneſs, and how none are actually juſtified till they believe, though prepared to have been here inſerted, yet to prevent the exceſs of this diſcourſe, ſhall be wholly ſuperceded.</p>
               <p>Only a little how upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving we are actually juſtified. Juſtification is God's act, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. A man is then juſtified, when he is conſtituted righteous in law; now this is done by <hi>God's imputing and accounting the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt ours,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. 24. <hi>Rom. 5. 19 So that he is made our righteouſneſs, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and we are as righteous through him as God can require or doth deſire, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. It is no more harſh that his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be thus made ours, then that our ſins ſhould be made his, which the Apoſtle expreſly aſſerts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and we have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:180409:113"/> before opened. Now God may be ſaid to juſtifie ſuch a perſon two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In his ſecret acquitting of him within himſelf, accounting of him as righteous, and in a ſtate of favour. He that was in a ſtate of hatred before, the obligation to puniſhment being now diſſolved, is accounted of as in a ſtate of friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In the conſtituting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in the Goſpel, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes is juſtified.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:180409:121"/> nature is an abhorrency? and ſhall we aſcribe this to the holy and righteous Governour of the world. See the foregoing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe from pag. 8. to 16. But I ſuppoſe the Gentleman thought of ſerving himſelf by one part of the Text, not conſidering how ruinous to his whole enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the other part would prove; and indeed there is nothing more uſual with that ſort of men, than to urge their miſtaken ſenſe of one part of Scripture, to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the true meaning of another, but to reply to the place.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) I deny that it is againſt juſtice to condemn one that is <hi>perſonally</hi> innocent, when he hath put himſelf <hi>legally</hi> in the room of criminals. It is no ways againſt equity to ſend a perſon to priſon, who poſſibly may live &amp; dy there and have his whole poſterity beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, who never contracted one penny deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:180409:122"/> bound for anothers: So here though Chriſt was perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent, yet he ſtood legally in the room of the guilty, and it was that which he had choſen, and in a matter wherein he had as much power as any of us have in our eſtates; ſee before from pag. 93. to 107.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) I affirm that theſe words which the Adverſary ſeeks relief to his cauſe from, do utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; <hi>For if he that condemneth the juſt be an abomination to the Lord?</hi> how will they ſalve the righteouſneſs of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Chriſt who was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon to pain and death, which is the puniſhment of the nocent, who as he had no ſin of his own, ſo according to them, he ſtood charged with no ſin of ours: Death being conſtituted the penalty of ſin, could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Anſwer, (1.) There are caſes wherein it is poſſible that the debtor may be pardoned, and yet the debt paid; as in caſe he that paid it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the Debtor himſelf, nor did it at his entreaty, but was rather aſſigned by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor. (2.) Theſe Gentlemen all a long confound pecuniary debts with poenal; and a meer Creditor, with a Governour, which is wilfully to err in the caſe; ſee the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 50. to 58. ſin is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> a <hi>crime,</hi> and only <hi>metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi> a <hi>debt;</hi> and God is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> a <hi>Governour,</hi> and only <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically</hi> a Creditor. Now the Socinians deſert the proper conſideration both of ſin, and God; and in this whole affair, purſue only the metaphorical; which in plain Engliſh is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to miſtake. Thus we have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:180409:132"/> ſeen that the Doctrine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs upon a ſatisfaction, is not contradictory to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us ſee in the next place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be diſagreeable to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and firſt the adverſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it as contrary to thoſe Scriptures, which ſpeak of Gods pardoning, forgiving and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, through Jeſus Chriſt, or through his blood; and here he quotes ſeveral places, where there is mention of forgiveneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the blood of Chriſt; as</hi> Luk. 3. 3. Mat. 26. 28. Act. 2. 38. and 3. 19. and 5. 31. and 10. 43. and 13. 38.</p>
                  <p>To all which I Anſ. (1.) That theſe Scriptures are ſo far from being ſerviceable to the deſign they were brought for, that they are deſtructive of it; for we have already demonſtrated, that to be pardoned <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> and through <hi>the bloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:180409:132"/> a ſatisfaction, and by vertue of Chriſts blood as a price and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. (2.) This whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs upon the old miſtake, which we have ſo oft taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſin cannot be forgiven, becauſe it is ſatisfied for, whereas ſatisfaction is ſo far from diminiſhing the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of forgiveneſs, that it exalts it: it is the more free to us, that it was bought by Chriſt; God expreſſeth more grace in giving Chriſt to purchaſe it, then (ſuppoſing it had been poſſible) if he had remitted ſin without the intervention of ſuch inducement and means: <hi>majus beneficium, quod cum tanta moleſtia praeſtitum.</hi> The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of remiſſion is ſo far from being hereby darkned, that it is rendred the more illuſtrious. For us to have bought it, had been altogether inconſiſtent with its being free; but for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:180409:133"/> Chriſt to have bought it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanceth its freedom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to what he adds, That we are taught to Pray, That God would forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors,</hi> Matth. 6. 12. <hi>and that our Heavenly Father forgives us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive men theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, that in theſe places, <hi>res comparatur cum re, non modus cum modo.</hi> We are to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>mercy,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of mercy. The <hi>as</hi> is not a <hi>note</hi> of univerſal parity, but a note of ſome ſimilitude; we are to be ſincerely merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as God is, but in the manner of beſtowing mercy, God takes one way, and we another; this is evident in that we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to forgive our enemies, though they abide Enemies, whereas this Gentlemans friends confeſs (and I ſuppoſe he will not diſſent from the Tribe) that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:180409:133"/> God cannot in honour forgive ſin, but in caſe of repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the Parable which he quotes,</hi> Matth. 18. 32, 33. I Anſwer, We muſt not ſet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables upon more feet than they will go, nor compel them more miles than they do intend. The ſcope of a Parable is alwayes the Key of it: and the ſcope of this, is only to ſhew that they who are implacable to their Brethren, ſhall find others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable to them; and that they who expect mercy to be ſhewn to them, ſhould expreſs mercy to others. But the intendment of it is neither to ſhew that God is a meer Creditor, nor that he forgives ſin without a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but at moſt that he hath received no ſatisfaction from us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having ſeen the Adverſaries faileur in this aſſault, let us try the next. To forgive ſin upon a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:180409:134"/> ſatisfaction, is contrary to all the Scriptures which attribute our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the grace mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and to prove this, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Scriptures are brought,</hi> Exod. 34. 5, 6, 7. Pſal. 103. 8, 10, 13. Jer. 3. 3. Joel 2. 3. Jonah 4. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 3. Luk. 1. 77, 78. Eph. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. Rom. 3. 24.</p>
                  <p>For Anſw. Let not the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be ſurpriſed with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Scriptures miſalledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the letter of Scripture, brought againſt the intendment of the ſpirit of God in it, is not Scripture. He does here as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eadem ſemper oberrare chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> that remiſſion and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are of Grace, we readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and affirm, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:180409:134"/> to the other. The fulleſt and freeſt grace in the giving Chriſt to ſatisfie, in the accepting that ſatisfaction in our ſtead, and applying the merit of it to our ſouls, and yet ſtill the holineſs and juſtice of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſuch, as that he could not pardon ſin without a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the conſiſtency of theſe two is largely treated and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and we referr the Reader thither, to avoid repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But ſaith the adverſary, there is nothing more contrary to grace, than to give nothing but what is paid for.</hi>

                  <p>Anſw. It is true, if the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been taken of us, to whom the favour is ſhewn; or if the ſatisfaction had been of our contriving and procuring; but nothing being paid by us, nor the leaſt influence of ours into the affair. It was meer
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:180409:135"/> grace that was the impulſive cauſe, of Gods giving Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 3. 16. 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10. Rom.</hi> 5. 8. It was meer grace that gave him for ſuch a number, <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But there is one text that the Gentleman ſeems to reckon on, more than the reſt, it is</hi> Jam. 2. 13.—<hi>and mercy rejoyceth againſt judgement; where he ſaith mercy is oppoſed to ſatisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. (1.) It is not certain whether by mercy, we are to underſtand Gods mercy, or mans; many Interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the laſt. (2.) Granting him his principle, that it is to be underſtood of Gods mercy, yet I deny his inference, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ſatisfaction; in order to the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe, I ſay that as juſtice is an attribute of God, he hath
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:180409:135"/> no leſs of that, than of mercy; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he is as juſt as he is gracious, that is, he is infinitely both: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f we take mercy for the effects of his mercy, then, in this life God is more ready to ſhew effects of mercy, than of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aid to be ſlow to anger; and the preſent time, is called the time of long-ſufferance: whereas the day of Judgement is called the day of wrath. God is infinite as well as merciful, but the meaning of the Text is, that in this life he is more in the diſcoveries of his mercy, than his juſtice; but this is ſo far from excluding a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſuppoſeth it. There is one Scripture I made uſe of in my Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> Exod. 34. 7. <hi>and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary would wreſt out of my hand, but without giving the

And thus we have ſeen that to pardon ſin upon a ſatisfaction, is neither contrary

                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. That you may once for all ſee, at what kind of rate theſe Gentlemen diſpute, I will aſk him theſe Queſtions. (1.) Whether God might not have damned all (mankind, without being a Tyrant or cruel? and yet I ſuppoſe, we ſhould pronounce it cruelty in any Governour, to deſtroy all his ſubjects, even ſuppoſing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:180409:148"/> them guilty of a very hainous fault. (2.) Is it cruelty for God to condemn men for little ſins, when continued in without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? (or will he ſay that there are ſome ſins in their own nature Venial) and yet I think we ſhould call it cruelty for a Magiſtrate to cut of his ſubjects for every little fault, though perſevered in. (3.) Are there not ſome caſes, wherein Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, without deſtroying the ends of Government and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Laws to contempt, cannot forgive offences? and ſhall we call it Tyranny in God to ſecure the honour of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to preſerve his Laws from reproach and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (4.) It no wayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that becauſe men may in ſome caſes pardon without a ſatisfaction, therefore God ſhould; both becauſe mens Laws are often arbitrary, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:180409:148"/> in many caſes only <hi>ad terrorem</hi> (where <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> would be <hi>ſumma injuria</hi>) as likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe juſtice is of the nature of no Governour, but God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas he adds that I cited</hi> Gen. 18. 25. <hi>in a quite contrary ſenſe to its true meaning, becauſe</hi> Abraham <hi>urged it againſt Gods deſtroying the few Righteous with the many wicked; but I urge for the many righteous, or of one equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to many, that a few wicked may go free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. (1.) The end I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it for, was that ſeeing ſin in reſpect of its nature deſerves puniſhment, therefore God as juſt Governour was obliged to ſee that it ſhould have its due; and whatever the Gentleman ſayes to the contrary, I do not ſee but that it was pertinently alledged. For ſeeing he ought as he is judge and Rector to do right, and puniſhment being
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:180409:149"/> that which in right belongs to ſin, he was bound to ſee that it ſhould not miſs it. (2.) <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> treated with God only in and through Chriſt, and what ever was the matter of his Prayer, it was tendred in the vertue, and accepted through the merit of Chriſts Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it's only upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the blood of Chriſt, that it becomes Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with God to pardon any. (3.) How Chriſt is equivalent to many, and how no pains were thrown upon him but upon his own election, and conſequently how there was no cruelty in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting; what he had choſen to undergoe, is all at large before opened, and I have more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy both for my ſelf and my Reader than to repeat it. I know no more under this head added by my Adverſary, but a Blaſphemy which I care not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:180409:149"/> to mention, but ſhall leave it to God to avenge.</p>

                  <p>Anſw. (1.)

Whereas I brought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Texts which I appehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full to the proof of Chriſts
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:180409:153"/> bearing, what we ſhould have born; not one word offered by way of formal Reply to any of them, only two or three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cavils. (2.) It doth not follow that becauſe Chriſt bare, what we ſhould have born, therefore he behoved to ſuffer for ever, and deſpair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may ſee fully opened, <hi>p. 107. to</hi> 111.</p>
                  <p>That the Agony of Chriſt proceeded not meerly from a foreſight of temporal death, was aſſerted and proved in my Sermon. <hi>Now at this the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Cavils, but inſtead of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any thing to the purpoſe, he only tells us that Chriſt being our Captain, was to experience as great tryals, as his Souldiers meet with, and ſeeing they are often by their ſufferings, put into Agony, therefore it was convenient that in the ſame he by his example ſhould go before them.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Anſw. Did ever a perſon who had not loſt his reaſon, argue ſo to the prejudice of his own cauſe, for (1.) Many of his Souldiers bear the worſt that befalls them, with leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation than he did: how many of the Martyrs have hugg're their gibbets, and ſung in the flames; now ſurely if it had been only the apprehenſion and previſion of bodily death which influenced and operated upon Chriſt, it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that leſs courage, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſpirit, ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf in the <hi>Leader,</hi> than doth in the followers.

                  <p>After I had declared in my Sermon, that Chriſt ſuffered what we ſhould have ſuffered, I endeavoured next to prove that he did it in our room, and to that end brought many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, three or four of which the Adverſary is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, but inſtead of invalidating the Expoſitions which I gave of them, or anſwering the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were raiſed from them,</p>

                  <p>Anſw. (1.) I deny the ſequel, It is a ſtrange kind of arguing, becauſe a word hath ſuch a ſignification ſometimes, therefore it muſt alwayes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſo.

                  <p>The next thing he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is my alledging that Chriſt by vertue of the ſatisfaction which he had made, and the redundancy of merit which was in his obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, had purchaſed grace for us, ſo that God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was bound to give it to ſo many as he had bought it for, to which purpoſe I had cited, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.
